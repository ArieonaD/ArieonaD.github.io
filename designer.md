TechFolio Designer is a cross-platform desktop application, implemented using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), which is intended to simplify the management of your professional portfolios. 

TechFolio Designer is under initial development, and does not yet support all aspects of TechFolio management. We hope that you will find it convenient to use even in its preliminary state.

## Installation

TechFolio Designer requires that you have `git` installed as a command line tool.  To install Git, please follow the appropriate instructions for your operating systems at the [Git Download Page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 

Before installing TechFolio Designer, please verify that you have successfully installed git by opening a shell and typing `git --version`. (On Windows, be sure that the git command runs in a "regular" shell, not just a PowerShell.)

After you have installed git, go to the [TechFolioDesigner Release Page](https://github.com/techfolios/techfoliodesigner/releases) and download a copy of the latest release appropriate for your platform. We strive to have releases for Windows, Macintosh, and Unix.
